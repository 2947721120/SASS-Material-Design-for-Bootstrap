## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to extend, within Bootstrap, the options available to the developer / designer in line with the Google Material Design concepts.

## Developing

Install SASS and Bower if you need them

```
sudo gem install sass
sudo npm install -g bower
```

Use Bower to install Bootstrap (SASS) and then launch a watcher (or manually build your files).

```
bower install
sass --watch assets/material.scss:pages/css/material-bootstrap.css
```

You can then view the site in your browser at ./pages/index.html
